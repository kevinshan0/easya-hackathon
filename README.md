## üõ†Ô∏è How the Smart Contract Works

> **Note:** If your project does not include a custom smart contract, clarify that here.  
> If you do have a smart contract, describe its purpose, main functions, and how it interacts with the Polkadot Asset Hub.

This project does not deploy a custom smart contract. Instead, it aggregates and analyzes DeFi protocol data from the Polkadot ecosystem, leveraging existing protocols and parachains. All user interactions are non-custodial and occur via the user's Polkadot wallet.
