## üõ†Ô∏è How the Smart Contract Works

This project includes a custom smart contract deployed on the Polkadot Asset Hub (EVM-compatible parachain on Polkadot). The contract is called **YIELDRATES** and is responsible for storing and managing yield rate entries for different chains.

- **Contract Name:** YIELDRATES
- **Contract Address:** `0xa0c289571683a8C17ACb5F0312d84084c43b30BD`
- **Network/Chain:** Polkadot Asset Hub (Westend)
- **Block Explorer Link:** [View the deployed contract on Asset Hub](https://assethub-westend.subscan.io/account/0xa0c289571683a8C17ACb5F0312d84084c43b30BD)

### Main Functions

- `addEntry(bytes32 chain, bytes32 data)`: Add a new yield rate entry for a specific chain.
- `updateEntry(uint256 index, bytes32 data)`: Update an existing yield rate entry by index.
- `entries(uint256 index)`: View a specific entry by index.
- `getEntriesCount()`: Get the total number of entries.
- `getEntry(uint256 index)`: Retrieve a specific entry's details.
- `owner()`: Returns the owner of the contract.

The contract interacts with the frontend to allow users to view and update yield rate data in a decentralized and transparent manner.
